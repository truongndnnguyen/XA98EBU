<h1>Victorians Warned To Prepare For Fire Season Now</h1>
<div class="posted">POSTED: 06 November 2015</div>

<p>Victorians have been urged to prepare for the upcoming summer fire season, which is forecast to be long, hot and dry across the state.</p>

<p>Fire Action Week, 1-8 November, is Victoria’s annual fire planning and preparation week. The week also signals the start of the annual Summer Fire Campaign, in partnership with emergency services.</p>

<p>So far this season, emergency crews have responded to more than 1,000 fires across the state, including 385 bush, scrub and grassfires in just one week in early October.</p>

<p>In 2014-15, emergency services responded to around 4,250 bush and grass fires.</p>

<p>For those living near bush or grassland leaving early is the safest option on a high-risk fire day.</p>

<p>Emergency Management Commissioner Craig Lapsley said Fire Action Week was an opportunity to think about fire risk where you live, prepare your property, and decide what you’ll do if a fire starts in your area this summer.</p>

<p>“Understand your risk, where to get information and have conversations so that you know exactly what to do when the high winds fan fires towards your home,” Mr Lapsley said.</p>

<p>“Knowing the Fire Danger rating system is really important. You should know where to find it, on the web or an app or on roadside signs.</p>

<p>“Think about what you’re going to do if the Fire Danger Rating is Severe, Extreme or Code Red.</p>

<p>“Know what the ratings mean about the weather and fire conditions, and think about what you’ll do to get ready or take action.</p>

<p>“Know your information sources and remember, always have more than one. The radio is a really good source of information, emergency broadcasters work with us to get information and warnings out to you.</p>

<p>“Fire Action Week in Victoria is a reminder to you to have the discussion do the work, have the discussions and make decisions that will save your life.”</p>
