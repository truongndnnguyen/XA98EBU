    <h2>Warning Systems</h2>
    <p>The Victoria State Emergency Service and the Bureau of Meteorology work together to warn the community about storms. Severe thunderstorm and severe weather warnings for Victoria can be found on the:<br/>
    <a class="external" href="http://www.emergency.vic.gov.au/">VicEmergency website</a><br/>
    <a class="external" href="http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/warnings/">Bureau of Meteorology website</a></p>
    <p>Severe Weather Warnings are issued by the Bureau of Meteorology when the predicated weather conditions are likely to endanger life or property.  Not all warnings eventuate into dangerous conditions however Victoria SES advises that community members take every warning seriously. The consequences of not preparing for a storm can be far greater than the inconvenience of being over prepared.</p>
